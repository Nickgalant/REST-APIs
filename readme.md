# REST API Tutorial with Axios and Express

## Project Overview

Welcome to the REST API Tutorial project! This project is designed to teach you how to build and interact with RESTful APIs using two popular technologies: Axios and Express. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to perform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

## Introduction
### What is Express?
Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is used to build web applications and APIs. In this project, we will use Express to create a simple RESTful API.

### What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed on your machine
* npm (Node Package Manager) installed
